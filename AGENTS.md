# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.

## Session Phrase Mapping

When the user says `see the running browser`, interpret it as:
`check the Chrome DevTools MCP server`.

## Safety Rules

- Never publish passwords, API keys, or tokens to git, npm, Docker, logs, or screenshots.
- Never commit `.env` files. Keep `backend/.env`, `frontend/.env`, `.env`, and `.env.local` out of git.
- Before any commit, verify no secrets are staged.
- `.gitignore` already excludes the main env-file patterns; preserve that coverage if you edit it.

## Browser Rules

- Use the already-running Chrome Beta instance for browser debugging. Do not launch a new browser when the user refers to the running or open browser.
- Chrome Beta binary on macOS: `/Applications/Google Chrome Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Beta`
- Expected remote debugging port: `9222`
- DevTools MCP should target `http://127.0.0.1:9222`
- If Chrome DevTools shows regular Chrome tabs instead of Chrome Beta, stop and ask the user to relaunch the correct browser.
- If nothing is available on port `9222`, ask the user to launch Chrome Beta. Do not launch it yourself.

## Project Overview

This repo is the `Visualang` app: a language-learning video companion that turns a YouTube URL or uploaded audio file into transcript-driven storybook visuals and an exported video. Frontend lives in `frontend/`; backend lives in `backend/`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install frontend deps
pnpm install

# Run both apps from repo root
pnpm dev

# Run backend only
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Run frontend only
cd frontend
pnpm dev

# Build frontend
cd frontend
pnpm build

# Run tests
pytest tests/test_visualang_phase2.py -v
pytest tests/test_generate.py -v
pytest tests/test_export.py -v
```

## Environment

- Backend expects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `NUNCHAKU_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`.
- Frontend uses `VITE_API_URL` and defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.
- Generated backend image assets are served from `/tmp/visualang_images` at `/images/*`.

## Architecture Summary

### Frontend

- Stack: React 19 + Vite.
- Entry files: `frontend/src/main.jsx`, `frontend/src/App.jsx`.
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` orchestrates transcript fetch, concept extraction, SSE image generation, preview, and export polling.
- `frontend/src/config.js` holds the backend base URL.

### Backend

- Stack: FastAPI.
- Entry file: `backend/main.py`.
- Routers:
  - `backend/routers/transcript.py`
  - `backend/routers/concepts.py`
  - `backend/routers/generate.py`
  - `backend/routers/export.py`
  - `backend/routers/metrics.py`
  - `backend/routers/demo.py`
- Health check: `GET /health`

### Runtime Agents

- Visualang backend includes three Anthropic-powered runtime agents in `backend/agents/`:
  - `TranscriptGate`
  - `ConceptExtractor`
  - `ImagePromptRewriter`
- They are wired through the backend routers and documented in detail in `backend/AGENTS.md`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_visualang_phase2.py` covers orchestration flow.
- `tests/test_generate.py` covers generation router behavior.
- `tests/test_export.py` covers export packaging behavior.

## Working Conventions

- Prefer focused edits over broad rewrites; preserve the current frontend/backend split.
- Treat `backend/.env` as local-only. Never print or copy real secrets into docs, fixtures, or commit messages.
- Shared behavior should usually be coordinated through API contracts, not duplicated logic.
- When changing the generation pipeline, check both `frontend/src/App.jsx` and the corresponding backend router payloads.
- When changing backend agents, also consult `backend/AGENTS.md` before editing prompts, tool wiring, or model selection.
