# VisuaLang

VisuaLang is a language-learning video companion built with React and FastAPI. It takes a YouTube video or Shorts URL, or an uploaded audio file, extracts a transcript, turns key moments into storybook-style images, previews the sequence in the browser, and exports a downloadable video package.

> ⚠️ At the moment, YouTube video and Shorts links only work reliably in local development.
On the deployed app, YouTube ingestion may fail because hosted environments like Render are often blocked by YouTube.

## What VisuaLang Does Today

- Accepts a YouTube video link, YouTube Shorts link, or local audio upload.
- Fetches YouTube captions when available and falls back to transcribing extracted audio when they are not.
- Runs a transcript gate before the expensive parts of the pipeline.
- Extracts visual concepts with backend runtime agents.
- Streams image generation progress from the backend to the frontend.
- Previews synced audio + illustrated scenes in the browser player.
- Starts an FFmpeg export job in the background and exposes video, transcript, and image downloads.
- Supports seeded demo fixtures and lightweight in-memory metrics for demos.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js with `pnpm`
- Python 3
- `ffmpeg` available on your shell path for video export

### Quick start

1. Install frontend and root workspace dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Create local env files:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
printf "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000\n" > frontend/.env
```

3. Install backend dependencies in your active Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

4. Run both apps from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The root `pnpm dev` script starts:

- the backend with `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload`
- the frontend with `cd frontend && pnpm dev`

Because of that, make sure the Python environment with `uvicorn` and backend dependencies is active in the same shell before you run `pnpm dev`.

### Run services separately

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Frontend build:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

## Environment Setup

Keep all env files local only. `.env`, `.env.local`, `frontend/.env`, and `backend/.env` are gitignored and should stay that way.

### Backend: `backend/.env`

The backend currently expects these variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
NUNCHAKU_API_KEY=sk-nunchaku-...
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
YOUTUBE_PROXY_ENABLED=false
YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTP_URL=
YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTPS_URL=
NUNCHAKU_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=2.0
NUNCHAKU_MAX_429_RETRIES=4
NUNCHAKU_BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS=3.0
NUNCHAKU_ENABLE_REWRITE_RECOVERY=false
```

Notes:

- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated list.
- Hosted YouTube ingestion on Render is likely to fail without a rotating proxy because YouTube blocks many cloud-provider IPs.
- Set `YOUTUBE_PROXY_ENABLED=true` and configure `YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTP_URL` and/or `YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTPS_URL` when you want hosted YouTube transcript fetches and `yt-dlp` requests to run through a proxy.
- If only one proxy URL is provided, the backend reuses it for both transcript fetches and `yt-dlp` requests.
- The Nunchaku retry and throttle settings control spacing and backoff around image generation requests.
- Generated images and uploaded audio are stored under `/tmp/visualang_images`.

### Frontend: `frontend/.env`

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

If omitted, the frontend falls back to `http://localhost:8000`.

## How The Pipeline Works

1. `POST /transcript`
   Accepts either JSON with a YouTube video or Shorts URL, or multipart upload with an audio file. YouTube first tries `youtube-transcript-api`, then falls back to `yt-dlp` + OpenAI transcription when captions are unavailable or fail to load; local uploads use OpenAI transcription directly.
2. Transcript gate
   `TranscriptGate` evaluates whether the transcript is usable before the rest of the pipeline runs.
3. `POST /concepts`
   `ConceptExtractor` turns transcript segments into visual moments with image prompts.
4. `POST /generate`
   The backend generates images serially through Nunchaku and streams progress back over server-sent events.
5. Browser preview
   The React player preloads generated images, syncs them to audio, and applies Ken Burns style motion and fades.
6. `POST /export`
   The backend starts an FFmpeg export job, then the frontend polls for completion and exposes download links for the final video, transcript, and image zip.
7. Demo + observability helpers
   Seeded demos are served from `/demo/*`, and rolling in-memory stats are exposed from `/metrics`.

## Contributor Notes

- The backend runtime agents are documented in [backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md).
- The main frontend orchestration lives in `frontend/src/App.jsx`.
- The browser preview player lives in `frontend/src/components/Player.jsx`.
- Generated assets are served from `/tmp/visualang_images` through `/images/*` and `/media/audio/*`.
- Seeded demo fixtures are generated by `backend/scripts/seed_demo.py` and can be consumed with `?demo=<slug>` in the frontend URL.
- `GET /health` is the basic backend health check.
- `GET /metrics` and `POST /metrics/reset` are in-memory demo-oriented endpoints, not production monitoring.

## Testing

Run the local VisuaLang test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/test_visualang_phase2.py -v
pytest tests/test_generate.py -v
pytest tests/test_export.py -v
```

Notes:

- These tests cover the current VisuaLang app rather than the old fork extras.
- `tests/test_generate.py` may require a valid `NUNCHAKU_API_KEY` depending on the path being exercised.
